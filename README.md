## Random Name Generator

## In this exercise for my bootcamp, we were tasked with creating a Random Name Generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


### Functionalities
- This application will generate 4 random names when you click "generate random names," and will generate up to 10 random names when you click "generate a desired amount of names." On this event, you will be prompted to enter a number between 1-10, and the names will populate.

### Updates
Some updates I hope to make to this project include:
- Expanding amount of names to be generated
- Changing styling, including the format of names and "clear names" event

## Run the app at https://jtaylor1204.github.io/Random-Name-Generator/.
